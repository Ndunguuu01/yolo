# Explanation of Kubernetes Project Implementation

## 1. Choice of Kubernetes Objects

**Deployments**: Used to manage the deployment of the web application. It ensures that the desired number of replicas of the application are running and handles rolling updates.

**StatefulSets**: Employed for the database deployment to ensure stable network identities and persistent storage. StatefulSets are crucial for applications that require stable storage and network identities, like databases.

**Services**: Used to expose the Pods to internet traffic. A LoadBalancer service type is used to provide a public IP for accessing the application.

**PersistentVolumes**: Used to provide persistent storage for the database. This ensures that data is not lost when the database Pod is deleted or recreated.

## 2. Method Used to Expose Pods

We used a LoadBalancer type Service to expose the web application to internet traffic. This service type creates a public IP address that routes traffic to the Pods, allowing external access.

## 3. Use of Persistent Storage

PersistentVolumes are configured to ensure that data persists even if the database Pod is restarted or recreated. This is crucial for maintaining the state of the application, such as user data and application configurations.

## 4. Git Workflow

Commits are made for each significant step in the project, including setting up the GKE cluster, creating Docker images, writing Kubernetes manifests, and deploying the application. Each commit is descriptive and helps in tracking the projectâ€™s evolution.

## 5. Good Practices

- **Docker Image Tag Naming**: Tags are used to identify different versions of the Docker image. This helps in rolling back to previous versions if needed.
- **Kubernetes Labels and Annotations**: Labels and annotations are used for managing and tracking Kubernetes objects. They help in organizing and querying the objects.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the deployment of a web application using Kubernetes on GKE, with a focus on best practices for container orchestration, persistent storage, and deployment strategies. By following the steps outlined, the application is deployed and managed efficiently, ensuring reliability and scalability.
