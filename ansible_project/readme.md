Ansible Project: E-commerce Platform Setup

Introduction

This project sets up an automated environment for an e-commerce platform using Ansible, Docker and Vagrant. We will automate the installation and configuration of the components.

Steps

1. Vagrant Setup

Create a Project Directory: Create a directory to hold your project files.

Initialize Vagrant: Initialize a Vagrant environment which will create a Vagrantfile for the VM.

Edit Vagrantfile: Edit the Vagrantfile to use the Ubuntu 20.04 box and allocate enough memory for the VM.

Up the VM: Bring up the VM with Vagrant.

2. Ansible Setup

Install Ansible: Make sure Ansible is installed on your local machine.

Directory Structure: Organize the project by creating directories for frontend, backend and database.

Ansible Playbook: Create an Ansible playbook that includes roles for frontend, backend and database.

Roles: Define tasks within each role. For example the frontend role might install and start Nginx, the backend role might install Docker.

3. Test Ansible Configuration

Vagrant VM: SSH into the Vagrant provisioned VM.

Run the Playbook: Run the Ansible playbook to setup the e-commerce platform.
